## Load Balancer Creation

The pictures in this folder include the following steps:
* Backend Creation
* Host and Route Rules
* Frontend Creation
* Load balancer configuration after being created
* Testing load balancer URL

These steps were done in the GCP GUI because I had some errors when running the equivalent commands from the CLI.
